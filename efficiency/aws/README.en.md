# Use Lifecycle Configuration scripts on SageMaker Domains enhance development efficiency

Lifecycle configuration scripts in SageMaker Domains and Notebooks allow you to automate various tasks and introduce efficiencies into your machine learning workflows. These scripts can be executed during specific lifecycle events, such as the creation or start-up of a notebook instance. By leveraging lifecycle configuration scripts, you can achieve the following benefits:

1. **Cost Optimization**: Implement automatic shutdown of idle notebook instances to reduce costs associated with running resources when not in use. This can be particularly beneficial for scenarios where notebook instances are frequently idle, ensuring that you only pay for the resources you actually utilize.

2. **Increased Productivity**: Enable local Docker mode for faster debugging and testing of your code. By running Docker in local mode, you can significantly reduce the time required for debugging and testing iterations, allowing for more efficient development cycles and quicker turnaround times.

3. **Consistent Environments**: Preload dependencies, packages, or datasets required for your machine learning workflows. This ensures a consistent environment across different notebook instances, minimizing setup time and reducing the potential for errors or inconsistencies.

4. **Automated Setup**: Automate the installation and configuration of tools, libraries, or frameworks required for your specific use cases. This streamlines the setup process and reduces the manual effort required, allowing you to focus on your core machine learning tasks.

5. **Customization**: Tailor the notebook environment to your specific needs by executing custom scripts or commands during the lifecycle events. This flexibility enables you to adapt the environment to your unique requirements, enhancing productivity and efficiency.
